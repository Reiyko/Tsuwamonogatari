  "description": "\"It is as I always say; if you have no bread, then train yourself!!\" The queen roared from the scaffold of the Place de la RÃ©volution. Forced from Versailles and then marched to the guillotine, Marie Antoinette vented her rage at the mob incited by revolutionary fervor, who were no longer the same people she had once loved.\nMarie was transformed into a muscular France: boasting of her muscular bulk she smashed the executioner's block, tore off the guillotine and used it as her weapon as she beat the Revolutionary army! \"I am France. The one and only France!\"\nThis is a story of rebirth. Muscle can only be rebuilt after it has been destroyed. Marie Antoinette, the most sad and strongest villainess, is about to turn the tables with her awesome muscle...!",
